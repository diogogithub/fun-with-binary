# Fun with Binary
2018

(c) Diogo Cordeiro

This is the README file for Fun with Binary, an app to help introducing students how binary numbers work.

Further information about Fun with Binary can be found in the project home page:

[https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/](https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/)

## Getting Started

Fun with Binary has two different modes:
- Online: Which has a little body to make everything more interactive.
- Offline: Which is more independent and can be used right away without any further technicality by accessing: [https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/offlinev2.html](https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/offlinev2.html)

### Prerequisites

### Offline Mode

There are no special prerequisites for the offline mode.

### Online Mode

At least: Arduino Uno with ESP8266-01, 6 leds (and 6 resistors), wires, breadboard.

You have instructions of how to build your own FwB in my blog: [https://blog.diogo.site/posts/fun-with-binary](https://blog.diogo.site/posts/fun-with-binary)

## MostraUP edition
This is a special edition that adds a password mechanism to force single player 
in online mode.
Every output messages were translated to Portuguese due to
University of Porto's Exhibition (MostraUP) being a portuguese event.
For regular usage (during a lecture) you will probably find standard release 2.0
a better option: https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary#releases

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.
