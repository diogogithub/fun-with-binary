# Fun with Binary
2018

(c) Diogo Cordeiro

This is the README file for Fun with Binary, an app to help introducing students how binary numbers work.

Further information about Fun with Binary can be found in the project home page:

[https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/](https://www.diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/)

## Getting Started

Fun with Binary is divided in three components, the Client, the Server, the Output.

### Prerequisites

### Server

For the server you need a webserver with PHP support (it can be localhost).

### Client

You can run it in the same server's webserver, although a ready to use live client was made avaiable in the folowing address:

```
http://diogo.site/projects/fun_with_binary/client/
```

Despite that, it might be interesting to convert it in an actual mobile app :)

### Output

For the Arduino based output you obviously need an arduino, 6 leds (from which three of them must be red and the other three of another color).

## Built With

* [Ratchet](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet) - The mobile targeted web framework used in the client

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.
