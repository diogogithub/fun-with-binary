Installation
============

Getting the offline mode up and running
---------------------------------------

Installing the basic Fun with Binary in offline mode is relatively easy.

1. Unpack the tarball you downloaded on your Web server. Usually a
   command like this will work:

       tar zxf funwithbinary-*.tar.gz

   ...which will make a funwithbinary-x.y.z subdirectory in your current
   directory. (If you don't have shell access on your Web server, you
   may have to unpack the tarball on your local computer and FTP the
   files to the server.)

2. Move the tarball to a directory of your choosing in your Web root
   directory. Usually something like this will work:

       mv funwithbinary-x.y.z /var/www/funwithbinary

   This will often make your Fun with Binary copy available in the funwithbinary
   path of your server, like "http://example.net/funwithbinary". If you know how
   to configure virtual hosts on your web server, you can try setting up
   "http://funwithbinary.example.net/" or the like.

3. You should now be able to navigate to your funwithbinary site's main
   directory and play :)

Getting the online mode up and running
--------------------------------------

Installing the basic Fun with Binary in offline mode is relatively easy.

1. Unpack the tarball you downloaded on your computer. Usually a
   command like this will work:

       tar zxf funwithbinary-*.tar.gz

   ...which will make a funwithbinary-x.y.z subdirectory in your current
   directory.

2. Minify the style.css with https://css.github.io/csso/csso.html and replace
   the line after <!-- CSS --> in the index.html with the result inside the tags
   <style>*result*</style>

3. In the script.js file enable the online mode in the Game Settings section,
   by changing "ONLINE_MODE = false; " to "ONLINE_MODE = true;"

4. Minify the script.js with http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/ and replace the
   line after <!-- JS --> in the index.html with the result inside the tags
   <script>*result*</script>
   Note: If you have problems minifying try replacing `let` by `var`, then 
   minify, and then reverting the replace in the minified version.

5. Make the resulting HTM usable with the following tool:
   https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/ESP8266-WiFi-Module/raw/master/convertHtml/convertHtml.jar

6. Upload the resulting code to the arduino board

7. You should now be able to play :)

Settings
========

Number of Leds
--------------

You can change the number of leds by editing the N_LEDS constant in the
Game Settings section of the script.js file. If you are using the Online Mode
you should also change the constant of the same name in the section of same name
in the server.ino file as well as adjust the LED GPIO array.

Show labels
-----------

You can change the default value of this option by editing the "show_labels"
variable in the Game Settings section of the script.js file. You can also
completely disable this feature by changing the value of HAVE_LABELS constant.

Easter Egg
----------

You can disable the easter egg by editing the EASTER_EGG constant in the
Game Settings section of the script.js file.

Change leds image and theme
---------------------------

You can change the LED_OFF and LED_ON paths in the Game Settings section of the
script.js file.
